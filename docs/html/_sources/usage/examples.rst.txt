Examples
===================

The following examples highlight the usage of **pyrecodes**. Examples are written as Jupyter notebooks and all the files necessary to run the examples are available on `Github <https://github.com/NikolaBlagojevic/pyrecodes/tree/main>`_.

All Examples:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   ./examples/example_1
   ./examples/example_2
   ./examples/example_3
   ./examples/example_4
   ./examples/example_5
   

`Example 1 <./examples/example_1.html>`_ is the simplest example and is a good starting point to understand how **pyrecodes** works. 

`Example 2 <./examples/example_2.html>`_  considers a slightly more complex system with a higher number of components and illustrates how **pyrecodes** handles complex component interdependencies. 

`Example 3 <./examples/example_3.html>`_  shows how **pyrecodes** integrates with third-party software - the SimCenter's R2DTool and how it can automatically build a **pyrecodes** model based on the R2DTool's outputs, creating a pipeline that extends the classical regional risk assessment tool to simulate regional recovery and assess resilience. 

`Example 4 <./examples/example_4.html>`_  builds on Example 3 by including the effect of interdependent infrastructure on building's functional recovery through supply/demand interfaces.

`Example 5 <./examples/example_5.html>`_  demonstrates how **pyrecodes** interfaces with third-party resource flow models through APIs.
