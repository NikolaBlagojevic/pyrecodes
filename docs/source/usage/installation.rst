Installing pyrecodes
====================

The prerequist for installing pyrecodes is to have Python v3.9.6 installed on your machine. 

The simplest way to install pyrecodes is to use `pip`:

.. code-block:: Python

    pip install pyrecodes

pyrecodes can also be installed by `cloning <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository>`_ the source code repository.

It's good practice to use a virtual environment when installing pyrecodes, to ensure dependencies are isolated from other Python projects on your machine.


Running Examples
----------------

To ensure that the installation is successful, please run Example 1 as specified in the Examples page.

All examples are written as Jupyter notebooks. More information on installing Jupyter notebooks can be found `here <https://jupyter.org/install>`_.  


Dependencies
------------

Apart from the Python's standard library, pyrecodes relies on several external packages:
 - numpy
 - pandas
 - geopandas
 - shapely
 - contextily (for visualization only)
 - matplotlib (for visualization only)
 - imageio (for visualization only)

These packages, along with their dependencies, define the requirements of the pyrecodes library.
