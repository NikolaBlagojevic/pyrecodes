class Secret(str):
	"""
	Subclass of :py:class:`str` that guards against accidentally printing a secret to the terminal.

	The actual value of the secret is accessed via the ``.value`` attribute.

	The protection should be maintained even when the secret is in a list, tuple, set or dict,
	but you should still refrain from printing objects containing the secret.

	The secret overrides the :meth:`~.__eq__` method of :class:`str`, so:

	.. code-block:: python

		>>> Secret("Barry as FLUFL") == "Barry as FLUFL"
		True

	.. versionadded:: 0.4.6
	.. autosummary-widths:: 1/2

	value: str  #: The actual value of the secret.

	def __new__(cls, value) -> "Secret":  # noqa: D102
		obj: Secret = super().__new__(cls, "<SECRET>")
		obj.value = str(value)
		return obj

	def __eq__(self, other) -> bool:
		return self.value == other

	def __hash__(self):
		return hash(self.value)
