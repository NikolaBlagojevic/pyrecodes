sections/article.html

<p>
  Hi there!
</p>
<p>
  You seem to be trying to write a Sphinx theme! Nice!
</p>
<p>
  What you're seeing is the initial scaffolding provided by <code>sphinx-basic-ng</code>
  which should serve as a decent base for most 3-column layouts.
  If this is the first time you're seeing this, you probably want to be looking at the
  <a href="https://sphinx-basic-ng.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/getting-started/">Getting Started</a>
  page in the documentation.
</p>
<p>
  Every "section" of this page is populated using a template. The name of the template
  is visible in the sections. To override it, create your own template in the same
  path in your templates directory. For example, creating a template named
  <code>sections/article.html</code> will override this section.
</p>
