r"""
Makes minor adjustments to the LaTeX layout.

* Increases the whitespace above function signatures by 5px,
  to prevent the function visually merging with the previous one.
* Remove unnecessary indentation and allow "raggedright" for the fields in
  the body of functions, which prevents ugly whitespace and line breaks.
* Disables justification for function signatures.
  This is a backport of changes from Sphinx 4 added in :github:pull:`8997 <sphinx-doc/sphinx>`.

  .. versionadded:: 2.12.0

* With Sphinx 3.5, doesn't add ``\sphinxAtStartPar`` before every paragraph.
  The change in :github:issue:`8781 <sphinx-doc/sphinx>` was to solve an issue with *tables*,
  but it isn't clear why it then gets added for *every* paragraph so this extension removes it.

  .. versionadded:: 2.13.0

* Configures hyperref to apply correct page numbering to the frontmatter.

  .. versionadded:: 2.14.0

* Optionally, configures the ``needspace`` package.

  The :confval:`needspace_amount` option can be set in ``conf.py`` to add the ``\needspace{}`` command
  before each ``addnodes.desc`` node (i.e. a function or class description).
  The amount of space is set by the ``needspace_amount`` option, e.g.:

  .. code-block:: python

      needspace_amount = r"4\baselineskip"

  .. versionadded:: 3.0.0


.. versionadded:: 2.10.0
.. extensions:: sphinx_toolbox.tweaks.latex_layout


.. versionchanged:: 3.0.0

	The functionality has moved to :mod:`sphinx_toolbox.latex.toc`.
	Please use that extension instead.
